# Software Engineering Principles and Patterns
Compilation of software engineering principles and patterns. A design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

## Software Architecture Design
  1. Pipe and Filter
  2. Shared Repository
  3. Model View Controller
  
## Design Principles
  1. Information Hiding (IH)
  2. Separation of Concerns (SoC)
  3. Open Close Principle (OCP)
  4. Program to Interface (P2I)
  5. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
  6. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
  
## Application Control Design Patterns
  1. Input Controller Patterns
    * Page Controller Pattern
    * Front Controller Pattern
  2. Request Control Patterns 
    * Command Pattern
    * Application Controller Pattern
    * Command Processor Pattern
  3. Output Control
    * Template View Pattern
    * Transform View Pattern
  4. Access Control Patterns
    * Firewall Proxy Pattern
    * Authroization Pattern

## Object Interaction Design Patterns
  1. Observer 
  2. Mediator
  3. Facade
  4. Memento
  5. Data Transfer
  6. Double Dispatch
